# UI Project Implementation Summary

## Overview

A new Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) UI project has been successfully added to the uServiceDemo solution. This UI provides a complete CRUD interface for managing Weather Forecast data through the existing API.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New UI Project (src/UI)
- **Technology**: Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) on .NET 9.0
- **Project Type**: Standalone Blazor WASM application
- **Reference**: Uses the existing `uServiceDemo.Contracts` project for shared data models

### 2. Core Features Implemented

#### a) List Weather Forecasts (`/weatherforecasts`)
- Displays all weather forecasts in a table
- Shows Date, Temperature (C/F), Summary, Created, Last Updated, Updated By
- Action buttons for Edit and Delete on each row
- "Create New" button to add forecasts

#### b) Create Weather Forecast (`/weatherforecasts/create`)
- Form with validation for:
  - Date (DateTime picker)
  - Temperature in Celsius (numeric input)
  - Summary (text input with min/max length validation)
- Cancel button to return to list
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

#### c) Edit Weather Forecast (`/weatherforecasts/edit/{id}`)
- Pre-populated form with existing forecast data
- Same validation as create form
- Save and Cancel buttons
- Error handling for not found and update failures

#### d) Delete Weather Forecast
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Integrated into the list view
- Error handling for failed deletions

### 3. Backend Enhancements

Since the Delete endpoint didn't exist, the following backend components were added:

#### a) Delete Use Case (`src/Application/UseCases/DeleteWeatherForecast/V1/`)
- `IDeleteWeatherForecastUseCase.cs` - Interface
- `DeleteWeatherForecastUseCase.cs` - Implementation with:
  - Validation (checks if forecast exists)
  - Command dispatching
  - Event publishing (WeatherForecastDeletedEvent)

#### b) Delete Command (`src/Application/Commands/`)
- `DeleteWeatherForecastCommand.cs` - Command object with ID and username

#### c) Delete Command Handler (`src/Application/CommandHandlers/`)
- `DeleteWeatherForecastCommandHandler.cs` - Handles delete command execution

#### d) Delete Event (`src/Events/`)
- `WeatherForecastDeletedEvent.cs` - Event raised when forecast is deleted

#### e) API Endpoint (`src/Api/Endpoints.cs`)
- Added `MapDelete("/{id:guid}", ...)` endpoint for DELETE operations
- Follows the same pattern as other endpoints (error handling, logging, OpenAPI)

### 4. Service Layer (src/UI/Services/)

#### WeatherForecastService
HTTP client service implementing:
- `GetAllAsync()` - Fetch all forecasts
- `GetByIdAsync(Guid id)` - Fetch single forecast
- `CreateAsync(AddWeatherForecastRequest)` - Create new forecast
- `UpdateAsync(Guid id, UpdateWeatherForecastRequest)` - Update forecast
- `DeleteAsync(Guid id)` - Delete forecast

### 5. Configuration

#### API Connection (`src/UI/wwwroot/appsettings.json`)
```json
{
  "ApiBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8081"
}
```
- Configurable API base URL
- Defaults to API Gateway address (port 8081)
- Can be changed for different environments

### 6. .NET Aspire Integration (`src/AppHost/Program.cs`)

The UI project has been integrated into the Aspire orchestration:
```csharp
var ui = builder.AddProject<Projects.uServiceDemo_UI>("ui");

builder.AddYarp("ApiGateway")
    .WithHostPort(8081)
    .WithConfiguration(yarp => { ... })
    .WithReference(ui);
```

### 7. Navigation

Updated `Layout/NavMenu.razor` to include:
- "Weather Forecasts" link in the main navigation
- Bootstrap icon (cloud-sun-fill)

### 8. Documentation

- `src/UI/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation including:
  - Features overview
  - Configuration instructions
  - Running instructions (standalone and with Aspire)
  - Project structure
  - API endpoints reference

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly** (9.0.9)
- **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.DevServer** (9.0.9)
- **uServiceDemo.Contracts** - Project reference

### API Endpoints Used
```
GET    /api/weatherforecast       - List all
GET    /api/weatherforecast/{id}  - Get by ID
POST   /api/weatherforecast       - Create
POST   /api/weatherforecast/{id}  - Update
DELETE /api/weatherforecast/{id}  - Delete (NEW)
```

### Architecture Patterns
- **Service Layer**: Abstraction for HTTP communication
- **Dependency Injection**: Services registered in Program.cs
- **Form Validation**: Using DataAnnotations from Contracts
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with user-friendly messages
- **Async/Await**: All operations are asynchronous

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files (74 total)
- `src/UI/` - Complete Blazor WASM project
- `src/Application/UseCases/DeleteWeatherForecast/V1/` - Delete use case
- `src/Application/Commands/DeleteWeatherForecastCommand.cs`
- `src/Application/CommandHandlers/DeleteWeatherForecastCommandHandler.cs`
- `src/Events/WeatherForecastDeletedEvent.cs`

### Modified Files
- `uServiceDemo.sln` - Added UI project reference
- `src/Api/Endpoints.cs` - Added Delete endpoint
- `src/AppHost/Program.cs` - Integrated UI with Aspire

## How to Run

### Option 1: Run Everything with .NET Aspire (Recommended)
```bash
cd src/AppHost
dotnet run
```
This will start all services including the UI at the configured port.

### Option 2: Run UI Standalone (for development)
```bash
cd src/UI
dotnet run
```
Note: API must be running separately at http://localhost:8081

## Next Steps / Potential Enhancements

1. **Authentication/Authorization**: Add user authentication to the UI
2. **Pagination**: Add pagination support for the list view
3. **Filtering/Sorting**: Add filter and sort capabilities
4. **Loading States**: Add loading indicators for better UX
5. **Toasts/Notifications**: Add toast notifications for success/error messages
6. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for the UI components and services
7. **E2E Tests**: Add end-to-end tests using Playwright or similar
8. **Responsive Design**: Enhance mobile responsiveness
9. **Dark Mode**: Add dark mode support
10. **Export Functionality**: Add ability to export data to CSV/Excel

## Compliance with Requirements

✅ **UI Project Created**: Blazor WASM project successfully created and integrated
✅ **Fetch Data**: GetAllAsync and GetByIdAsync implemented
✅ **List Data**: WeatherForecasts.razor page with table view
✅ **Create Data**: CreateWeatherForecast.razor page with form
✅ **Update Data**: EditWeatherForecast.razor page with pre-populated form
✅ **Delete Data**: Delete functionality with confirmation dialog + backend implementation
✅ **Blazor WASM**: Project uses Blazor WebAssembly technology

All requirements have been successfully implemented with minimal changes to existing code and following established patterns in the codebase.
